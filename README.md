# Adaptive form

I came across a great article where the author explained very clearly how Flexbox works in CSS - [An Interactive Guide to Flexbox](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/). As an example of the flexibility of using this tool, he shared an interesting form - [“4 layouts for the price of 1”](https://codepen.io/argyleink/pen/LYEegOO). With minimal code, it transforms depending on the screen size. I wanted to replicate this example and delve deeper into it. Also, I'm still not entirely confident in the correct usage of `flex-grow` and `flex-basis`. This served as good practice for me, even though the example is quite simple.
